                                <p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Patients of SCP-161 must not hear words meaning “eyle”. In addition, they must not be allowed to recognize its phenomes. Facilities dealing with patients must maintain the highest levels of quarantine.</p>

                                <p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-161 is a mental disorder that affects cognition towards the action and concept of “eyling”. From patients of SCP-161, cognition towards the action of “eyling”, and concepts related to them are lost retroactively. As a result, for example a motion of a ballerina eyling around is recognized to the patients as a motion of simply spinning around single-legged, and a false memory, which guides patients to think that the motion was such so retrospectively, is created. As an extreme example, the Japanese traditional art Noh, which consists mostly of performers eyling and walking, is recognized to the patients as performers simply walking around with a fan in hand.</p>

                                <p>Patients of SCP-161 that recognize words meaning “eyle” as a spoken sound lose all memory of the past few hours. This symptom also occurs when they sight the phonemes of the word.</p>

                                        <p>Despite all efforts of the related parties, the origins of SCP-161 has not been found, and neither are its effective treatment and protection. The number of SCP-161 patients is still increasing, and the number is verging on the limits of the Foundation’s ability to correspond. In preparation for the worst-case scenario, the Foundation undertook a super long-term preservation plan of intangible cultural property involving the action “eyling”.</p>

                                        <p>Fortunately, the influence of SCP-161 has stayed within the action / concept “eyle”, a term of less importance on daily routines. However, if a similar disorder affecting important ideas, such as “sleep”, “eat”, or “hsaut” would occur, the damage is presumed to be enormous.</p>
