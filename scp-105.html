                                <p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-105 is implanted with a tracking device and is currently housed at Site-Θ. SCP-105 is currently allowed Class 3 (restricted) socialization privileges with approved site personnel, granted based on continued good behavior and cooperation with Foundation personnel.</p>

                                <p>SCP-105's personal camera (designated SCP-105-B) is contained in a locked safe-deposit box at Site-Θ's High Value Item Storage Section. Standard positive-action defenses (explosive, chemical, biological, and memetic) are to be in place at all times while SCP-105-B is within containment.</p>

                                <p>SCP-105 and SCP-105-B or any other camera are only to be allowed to come into contact with approval of the current managing researcher.</p>

                                <p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-105 (formerly known as Iris Thompson) is a female human of European descent. Records indicate that SCP-105 was born in ████, making her ██ years old at the time of acquisition. She has blonde hair and blue eyes, and at the time of this article, is 1.54 meters in height and 50kg in weight. She does not appear to have any out-of-the-ordinary physical characteristics and appears to be, for all intents and purposes, a normal human being in good health.</p>

                                <p>SCP-105-B is a Polaroid One Step Express camera, manufactured in 1982. SCP-105-B does not appear to have any out-of-the-ordinary physical characteristics and appears to be, for all intents and purposes, a normal Polaroid camera, operating normally for all persons aside from SCP-105.</p>

                                <p>When SCP-105 holds a photograph taken by SCP-105-B, the photograph changes from a still image to that of a real-time image of the location in question. SCP-105 is also able to reach through the photograph and manipulate objects within reach of the original point at which the photograph was taken. Persons witnessing this manipulation report seeing a disembodied female hand (determined to be that of SCP-105) reaching out from an invisible portal and carrying out the actions indicated. SCP-105-B and the photographs taken by said camera have no unusual properties when used by any other person.</p>

                                <p>SCP-105 has demonstrated limited ability to manipulate objects through other photographs, but can only achieve fine control using photographs taken through SCP-105-B. So far, SCP-105 has only been able to significantly advance her ability by using photographs taken by SCP-105-B.</p>

                                        <p>SCP-105 was brought to the Foundation's attention shortly after the murder of ████ ██████. SCP-105 claimed to have been on the phone with her friend at the time of the murder, which was not corroborated by said friend or telephone records. SCP-105 was found covered in the blood of the victim, despite being at home, making her a prime suspect in the murder.</p>

                                        <p>After some time, SCP-105 informed her lawyer that she had, in fact, witnessed the murder through a photograph taken of her friend several days prior. The attorney in question disregarded the story and recommended that the subject plead guilty. Subject refused to do so and subsequently told her story in court, offering to demonstrate her ability. This lead to Foundation contact.</p>

                                        <p>Agents Adrian Andrews and Beatrix Maddox were dispatched to contain the subject, until SCP-105 demonstrated significant amnestic resistance preventing immediate custody. During the re-evaluation of SCP-105's capture and containment, SCP-105 was retrieved by a team associated with GOI-12 "Marshall, Carter, & Dark, Ltd.", suspected under Amos Marshall.</p>

                                        <p>Roughly two years later, SCP-105 was sold as the main event at an auction ran by GOI-12 to a group comprised of Kurt Leighton, Cassandra Barkley, and Oswald Klein, for a significantly reduced price than estimated. It is likely that GOI-12 spent more to acquire SCP-105 than was recouped upon her sale. GOI-12's reasons for involvement are currently unknown.

                                        <p>SCP-105's parents have been long-since informed that she was killed during the botched escape of another patient while both were in custody of the █████████ ██████ psychiatric care facility.</p>
